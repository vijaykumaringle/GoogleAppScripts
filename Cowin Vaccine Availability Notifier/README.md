# Cowin Vaccine Availability Notifier

<p>This is the code I wrote which can be confifured to be schdueled by Google App Scripts to check Cowin Vaccine Availability API after every 10min (or as per configuration). If vaccine slot is available then the information is passed by email to receipient about Center, Vaccine, Availability, Fees, Date etc.</p>
